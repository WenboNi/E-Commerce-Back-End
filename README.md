# E-Commerce Back-End Application (Tested Through Insomnia)

## Description
This application acts as the back end for an e-commerce site. We are taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

This application serves as an inventory management system for retailers. Users of this application can view the inventory by Category, Product, and Tag ID#. Functionality allows user to find all products, tags, and categories; find by product ID, category ID, or Tag ID; Create new products, tags, or categories, update each category by their respective IDs, and delete each category by its associated ID.

The walkthrough video will demonstrate how this is done via Insomnia
